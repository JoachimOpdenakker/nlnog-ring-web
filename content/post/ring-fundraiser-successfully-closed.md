Dear All,

We would like to share the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious results of our fund-raising effort with you!

Some background: In February 2012 we started a fundraiser to ensure the RING will have ample processing power for the next phase. Over the last 1.5 years the RING has grown to over one hundred nodes, and this was reaching the limitations of the current support systems. We are happy to announce these scalability problems are now a thing of the past!

We have raised a total of EUR 2200, brought together by the following generous organisations (listed in alphabetical order):

* [A2B Internet BV](http://www.a2b-internet.com/) (NL)
* [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com) (IE)
* [Association tetaneutral.net](http://www.tetaneutral.net/) (FR)
* [BIT BV](http://www.bit.nl/) (NL)
* [Duocast BV](http://www.duocast.nl/) (NL)
* [LCHost](http://www.lchost.co.uk/) (UK)
* [Nedzone Internet BV](http://www.nedzone.nl/) (NL)
* [PCExtreme BV](http://www.pcextreme.nl/">PCExtreme BV) (NL)
* [Previder BV](http://www.previder.nl/) (NL)
* [Snijders IT](http://snijders-it.nl/) (NL)
* [Solido Networks ApS](http://solidonetworks.com/) (DK)
* [Triple IT BV](http://www.triple-it.nl/en/) (NL)

In addition, the following participants made significant non-monetary donations (listed in alphabetical order):

* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) (virtual machines, IE)
* [Atrato IP Networks](http://www.atrato-ip.com/) (1 dedicated server, DE)
* [BIT](http://www.bit.nl/) (colocation, NL)
* [Ebay Classifieds Group](http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com) (hardware, NL)
* [Leaseweb](http://www.leaseweb.com/) (1 dedicated server, NL)
* [PCExtreme](http://www.pcextreme.nl/) (colocation, NL)

This brings us to a total of 5 servers dedicated to management, staging and other services, and two additional (virtual) servers for data crunching!

During the next couple of weeks we will be using the donated funds to purchase hardware, and/or upgrade the donated servers. We will report back to this list on how the different donations were put to use.

We expect the first new master server to go online before the end of this month!

We would like to express our gratitude to all parties that have made donations, and are helping us to make the RING a continued success.
