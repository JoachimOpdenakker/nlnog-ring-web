In december 2010 a few people gather together to create a more organized way of providing shell access to other network operators in the Dutch ISP scene. After a few days of hard work and mastering puppet we now can install, update and configure machines participants make available to the project in a few minutes.

Now, only a month later already 10 organisations have joined the project! Founding members include: BIT, Cambrium, ColoClue, Duocast, Easyhosting, Interconnect, InTouch, WideXS and XLSHosting.

I am looking forward to seeing this project grow and become an essential tool for network debugging in the Netherlands.
