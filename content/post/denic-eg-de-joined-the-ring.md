> We are .de All domains ending with .de are registered with us. We are the central registry of all domains under the country code .de. This means that we administer the register of all .de domains and thus ensure that each domain exists only once. Thanks to this register, you can access websites directly by simply entering the 'name' - we then assign it to the corresponding IP address. With more than 16 million domains, we run one of the largest Internet endings or 'Top Level Domains' in the world. We also ensure registration and operation of the German ENUM domains under .9.4.e164.arpa - the counterpart of domains for telephone numbers. We are a cooperative with around 300 members. Our member companies and organisations offer their customers Internet services and register and administer .de domains for them. Our Cooperative was founded in 1996 and its head office is in Frankfurt am Main.
