We are pleased to announce that this week we have reached the milestone of 500 active ring nodes!

The NLNOG RING started in december 2010 as a debugging tool for Dutch network operators to troubleshoot connectivity problems between their networks. Over the last nine years we've seen a steady growth and international expansion. We now have presence in 441 autonomous systems, spread over 55 countries on 6 continents.

We thank all [participants](https://ring.nlnog.net/participants/) and [sponsors](https://ring.nlnog.net/patrons/) for making this project a massive success!
