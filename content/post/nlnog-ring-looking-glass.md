In addition to the ring-user accessible SSH interface, there is now a gorgeous intuitive public web interface available for the NLNOG RING Looking Glass.

You can find it here: [http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/](http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/)

A particularly nice feature is `BGPMap`, which generates a graph based on current routing information, example:

[http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/prefix_bgpmap/lg01/ipv6?q=www.snijders-it.nl](http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/prefix_bgpmap/lg01/ipv6?q=www.snijders-it.nl)

I'd like to thank [Mehdi ABAAKOUK](http://www.sileht.net/) from tetaneutral.net for the excellent [bird-lg](https://github.com/sileht/bird-lg/) software.

If you want to setup a peering session with the looking glass, [drop us a line](/contact), for more information about the looking glass go to [toolbox/looking-glass](/toolbox/looking-glass).
