Yesterday, Job Snijders presented the NLNOG RING at the [RIPE 65](http://ripe65.ripe.net) Plenary meeting. In his presentation he illustrated how fast the RING has grown (137 hosts in 123 networks and 27 countries at this moment) and, more importantly, how powerful the RING has become. Various [tools](https://ring.nlnog.net/toolbox/) make debugging network related problems a lot easier. In his presentation Job also demonstrated the new (currently beta) [AMP](http://amp.ring.nlnog.net) tool, which can be used to detect various problems like packetloss, MTU issues and routability problems.
