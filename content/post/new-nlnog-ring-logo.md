I'm very happy to announce that the NLNOG RING Project has a shiny new logo designed by [Rayne Leroux](http://www.rayneleroux.com/). The logo is based on ideas from our community: the orange color symbolizes the Dutch roots of the project, the dots represent the distributed nodes and the ring shape emphasizes one of our core values: cooperation.

Now that we have obtained visually pleasing eye-candy maybe it's time to start thinking about a tshirt? :-)
