Clearnetworx - AS 394195 - joined the RING today.

> Founded in 2012, Clearnetworx was Montrose's first locally owned and operated fiber internet provider. Our team started by bringing the first affordable fiber internet into Western Slope communities for schools, hospitals, and businesses. Since then, we've constructed well over 200miles of fiber and brought fiber internet into both business and residential communities across the Western Slope.

Users can connect to clearnetworx01.ring.nlnog.net, which is located in United States.
