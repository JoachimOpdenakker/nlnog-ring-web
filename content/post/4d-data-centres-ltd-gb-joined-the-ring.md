4D Data Centres Ltd - AS 31463 - joined the RING today. First and foremost, 4D Data Centres is a colocation and connectivity provider. What makes us different from many other colocation and connectivity providers, is that we actually own and run our flagship Tier 3 data centre in Surrey and its an award-winning green data centre at that. Weve got our own dedicated technical team providing 24 hour support, we're carrier neutral and because were not owned by a larger organisation, when we say were independent, we really mean it. Having grown from being a relatively modest hosting company to a medium sized independent colocation provider thatu2019s going places (were one of the top 500 fastest growing tech companies in EMEA according to Deloitte), we've got plenty of experience working with SMEs and even some big name brands.
