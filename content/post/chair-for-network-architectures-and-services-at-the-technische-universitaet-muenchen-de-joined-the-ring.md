Chair for Network Architectures and Services at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen - AS 56357 - joined the RING today. In research and teaching we focus on components, methods and systems of digital telecommunication and networking. The general term for all these fields is Telematics (the combination of telecommunication and informatics). Today modern digital telecommunication systems offer a wide spectrum of services ranging from 'local' networks within buildings (Local Area Networks, LANs) to the worldwide infrastructure of telecommunication networks (Wide Area Networks, WANs) like the Internet. Topics of research and teaching are the basics of digital transmission systems and switching technology as well as Internet-based applications. Running within a computer network, these programs integrate the functions of individual computers, making them accessible to the rest of the network. This includes communication mechanisms for multimedia information such as language, technical data, text, graphics, photographs and film. Telematics opens up an extensive spectrum of new functions and services which has an immense practical importance for a wide range of applications.
