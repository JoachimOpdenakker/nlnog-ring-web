Previder - AS20847, a Dutch service provider based in the south-west of the Netherlands has decided to join the NLNOG RING and provided a machine named "previder01.ring.nlnog.net". <a href="http://www.previder.net/" target="_blank">Previder</a> (formely known as Introweb) was one of the first dutch internet providers to make IPv6 available on their DSL access network to regular end-users.

We are happy with their contribution and participation!
