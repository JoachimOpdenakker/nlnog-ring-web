In light of today's IPv6 events around the globe: I'm happy to announce we now have a very special node in the RING!

<a href="http://www.occaid.org/">OCCAID Inc</a> - AS 30071 - is a completely non-profit consortium which works with ISP communities to help deploy IPv6 connectivity and encourage networks to connect to the IPv6 internet. Currently, OCCAID operates a global IPv6 network infrastructure to facilitate connections and cooperation with public communities for IPv6.

This particular node will be used to experiment with relaxing the strict requirement that nodes must have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. We plan to support IPv6-only nodes in the future and this node will show us what scripts, tools and management approaches need to be modified to support IPv6-only nodes. I expect at least Smokeping and Munin to break, possibly Nagios. We will fix these one by one in the next few days. So stay tuned for an authentic bumpy IPv6 ride, and please bear with us while we future-proof the RING. :-)

Users can connect to occaid01.ring.nlnog.net (only over IPv6!), which is located in Seattle, USA.
