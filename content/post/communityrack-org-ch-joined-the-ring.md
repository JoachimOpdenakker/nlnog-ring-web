CommunityRack.org - AS 57118 - joined the RING today.

> CommunityRack.org is a Switzerland-based association for IT professionals. Our goal is to provide rack-space access, while maintaining more freedom and control over the infrastructure than classic environments. We also meet monthly and are very active within the swiss internet provider landscape.

Users can connect to communityrack01.ring.nlnog.net, which is located in Switzerland.
