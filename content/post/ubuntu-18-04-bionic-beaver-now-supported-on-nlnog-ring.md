We are pleased to inform you that we now support Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) 
for new ring node installs.

Unlike the migration to Ubuntu 16.04 we will not be performing a 'big
bang' upgrade of all existing ring nodes to release 18.04. Instead, we
will be asking each node owner to upgrade their own hosts. We will
contact all node owners with instructions in a couple of weeks.

We will be supporting Ubuntu 16.04 for some time to come. To simplify
our provisioning system we will most likely end our support before the
EOL date set by Canonical. Further updates on our plans will follow once
a timeline has been determined.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.
