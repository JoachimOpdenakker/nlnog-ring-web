PBW Communications, LLC - AS 16409 - joined the RING today.

> PBW Communications is an Internet Service Provider based in Baltimore, Maryland. With 20 years experience operating an ISP, we excel in delivering high quality Internet, Ethernet and Colocation services, and our considerable networking expertise is also available to our clients. We will work with you to fully understand what your unique needs and requirements are, and engineer a solution that is right for YOU. We've been active in the IT industry since the 1980's, and have worked with networking technologies since before UUCP was all the rage. From 300 baud to gigabit speeds and beyond, we've been on the job, working with the nascent systems that eventually grew to become the Internet we all know and love today. In all this time, we've worked extensively with networks and UNIX based computers of every type imaginable. From machines like Altos, Dec, NCR, AT&T 3b1's and 3b2's, Megadata, Corvis, Altair, Tandy, Sun, IBM and operating systems like Unix System V, BSD, Xenix, Linux, Windows, Novell, Pick, MS-DOS, CP/M, OS/2 to network technologies like UUCP, RS-422, Coax, Starlan, ArcNet, ISDN, Frame Relay, T-1, T-3, fiber optic and OC circuits - We've seen and worked with them all. We have extensive experience with telephony systems, having designed, installed, integrated and maintained many telephone and voice messaging systems. We've been involved with all manner of systems over the years, from the old 1A2 systems to today's modern VoIP systems. Remember when getting voice over a T-1 required a D-4 channel bank half the the size of a refrigerator? The VoIP systems we design and install today are compact, highly flexible, feature dense, and economical to deploy and maintain. From the design of the network, to the construction of the data centers, we have the experience and expertise to get YOUR job done.
