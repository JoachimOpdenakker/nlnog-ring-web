Grenode - AS 51083 - joined the RING today.

> Grenode (AS 51083) is a non-profit network operator in France, created in 2009. It provides connectivity to its members, which are themselves non-profit organizations: small local ISPs and alternative hosting providers. Grenode has its roots in a Do-It-Yourself culture in line with the values of the Federation des fournisseurs d'access a Internet associatifs (https://www.ffdn.org/en/ , known as Federation FDN) and the emerging Community Networks movement: members are allowed and encouraged to actively participate in running the network. This provides incredible educational value for the volunteers that get involved: they learn how interconnection works, how to use BGP, how to troubleshoot reachability issues, etc.

Users can connect to grenode01.ring.nlnog.net, which is located in France.
