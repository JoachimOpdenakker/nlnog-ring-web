Each RING node runs a health monitoring script to check various parameters, such as free disk space, external connectivity and DNS resolver status. A report of a nodeâ€™s health status is available on the following URL:
```
http://<node_name>.ring.nlnog.net/status.json
```

The health report has the following format:
```
{
  "info": {
    "success": true,
    "date": "2019-01-29T20:01:59.528466"
  },

```
Our administration system currently uses the reports to actively contact owners of RING nodes that have not completed their Ansible runs or for which there is a problem with IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. We encourage participants to add the above URL to their monitoring systems to actively monitor their own nodes.
